Big Vision Pictures Token (BVPToken)
🎬 Overview
Big Vision Pictures (BVP) is the world’s first fully crypto-funded film and television studio built natively on Arbitrum. We fuse traditional Hollywood-grade production infrastructure with a decentralized, Ethereum-secured Web3 ecosystem. Our native ERC-20 utility token, BVPToken, unlocks immersive access, decentralized funding, and community-driven governance across all stages of content creation.

🧱 Powered by Arbitrum L2 & L3 Orbit Subchains
BVP has implemented a custom Arbitrum Orbit L2 subchain and modular L3 extensions to serve as the digital production backbone. Core innovations include:

Orbit Rollups: Launch custom L2/L3 chains for each franchise, campaign, or fanbase with inherited Arbitrum security.

Nitro-Powered Scaling: Achieve 40,000 TPS and sub-second finality for live fan voting, real-time staking, and creative input.

Custom Gas Token: BVPToken doubles as the subchain's native gas currency.

ERC-4337 Support: Full account abstraction for gasless UX and meta-transactions.

🏗 Full On-Chain Film Production Stack
Our Arbitrum-native infrastructure replaces outdated studio systems with transparent smart contracts and modular DeFi mechanics:

Token-Based Studio Funding: All productions, facilities, and talent pipelines are funded via structured token sale phases.

Staking for Access (Not Rewards): Tiered experiential staking grants real-world access—red carpet premieres, set visits, and cameo appearances—with no inflationary emissions.

DeFi Integration: Seamless access to Aave, Uniswap, and GMX enables liquidity incentives, ticket financing, and programmable fan governance.

🔁 Subchain Rebate-Only Fee Architecture
Our L2/L3 design introduces revenue with no burns, no rewards:

Action	Fee to Treasury	User Rebate
Gas Payment (L2/L3)	20%	80%
Cross-Chain Bridge (In/Out)	0.1%	99.9%
BVP → USDC Swap	0.1%	99.9%

Fees are auto-routed via a GasRouter contract to corporate wallets, cliff-locked (60–90 days), and audited quarterly.
