#In‑House Rebate‑Only Subchain Overview

Based on our internal rebate‑only subchain mechanism—no burns, no rewards—this corporate chain architecture maximizes BVP value through transparent fee slices and refunds citeturn1file0:

Architecture & Flow: Ethereum L1 → Arbitrum Mainnet; L2 corporate chain with a GasRouter splitting 20% fees to treasury and 80% flows to core modules (Budget, Payroll, Revenue, Treasury, Governance).

L3 Micro‑Chains:

Production Ops: 0.005 BVP/tx (20% retained, 80% refunded)

Marketing & Distribution: Revenue→BVP (15% retained, 85% refunded)

Post‑Production & VFX: 10 BVP/mint (100% retained)

Finance & Compliance: Swap BVP→USDC (0.1% retained, net USDC refunded)

Treasury Management: Accumulates all fee slices and bridge fees, cliff‑locks funds for 60–90 days, and executes weekly sweeps to the L1 reserve vault.

Governance & Protections: DAO votes can tune fee slices, entry/exit fees, and lock durations in real time; on‑chain dashboards and quarterly attestations ensure full transparency and auditability.
