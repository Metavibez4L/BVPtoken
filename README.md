# Big Vision Pictures Token (BVPTOKEN)

## Overview

## Token Details
In-House Subchain Architecture
To supercharge film production workflows and fan engagement, BVP operates its own Arbitrum Orbit subchain—an L2 rollup tailor-made for our ecosystem. Key components include:

Programmable Subchains: Each franchise, event series, or fan community can spin up a dedicated rollup sharing Arbitrum’s security and liquidity, but with custom governance rules and economic parameters .

Nitro-Powered Scalability: Leveraging Arbitrum’s Nitro upgrade, the subchain achieves up to 40,000 TPS with sub-second finality, enabling real-time fan voting, instant tier unlocks, and high-volume on-chain interactions without gas shocks Big Vision Pictures Whi…Big Vision Pictures Whi….

Custom Gas Token & Abstraction: BVPTOKEN itself serves as gas for transactions, and account-abstraction (e.g., ERC-4337 meta-transactions) allows gasless experiences—critical for onboarding mainstream audiences and non-technical fans arbitrum_orbit_subchainsarbitrum_orbit_subchains.

Modular L3 Extensions: Future L3 networks can be deployed atop our main subchain for specialized use-cases—high-volume NFT drops, gamified storytelling modules, or interactive VR experiences—while seamless cross-chain messaging keeps assets and state in sync arbitrum_orbit_subchainsarbitrum_orbit_subchains.

Full Film Production Ecosystem
By integrating on-chain and off-chain workflows, the BVP in-house subchain becomes the backbone of a self-contained production engine:

Token-Backed Funding: Structured token sale phases fund studio acquisition, sound stages, housing for cast/crew, and post-production facilities.

On-Chain Participation: Token holders stake to unlock tiered benefits—access to set visits, red carpet premieres, behind-the-scenes content, and creative input on storylines and casting decisions.

Transparent Operations: Smart contracts automate treasury transfers, multi-sig approvals, and vendor payments; all on-chain activities inherit Ethereum-anchored security guarantees via Arbitrum’s fraud-proof model.

DeFi & Governance Integrations: Built-in compatibility with Arbitrum’s DeFi protocols (Aave, Uniswap, etc.) enables on-chain lending for ticket financing, liquidity incentives for token holders, and DAO-style fan governance for content curation.

Real-World Utility & Revenue: Finished content is licensed to streaming platforms; studio and equipment are rented to third-party productions; tokenomics drive recurring membership revenues—creating a flywheel of content output, community engagement, and ecosystem growth.

Together, these layers form a complete on-chain film production ecosystem, where BVP’s in-house subchain not only solves gas-fee and scalability challenges but also redefines fan engagement, funding transparency, and creative collaboration at scale.








# Supply & Allocation
Max Supply: 1 000 000 000 BVP

Circulating Supply (Year 1): 775 000 000 BVP (77.5 %)

Locked – Corporate Treasury: 225 000 000 BVP (22.5 %)

Cliff-locked for 60–90 days before any spending


# Rebate-Only Fee Mechanisms

Activity	Fee to Treasury	Refund to User
L2 & L3 Gas Fees	20 % of each BVP gas payment	80 % refunded immediately
Cross-Chain Bridge (In/Out)	0.1 % of bridged amount	99.9 % credited/redeemed
BVP → USDC Swap	0.1 % of swapped BVP	99.9 % USDC delivered

No burns, no extra “reward” tokens—every fee point either locks value in treasury or returns it.


# Treasury Accrual & Lock-Ups

All subchain-collected fees (gas slices, bridge fees, swap fees) flow into the L2 Corporate Treasury.

Cliff-Lock Window: 60–90 days after receipt before any disbursement.

Weekly Sweeps: Unspent BVP moved back to an L1 Reserve Vault for long-term hold.

DAO Governance: On-chain votes set release schedules, re-allocation for projects, and fee parameters.


# Net Impact

Usage-Driven Demand: Fees only when the network is used—governance, payments, swaps.

Temporary Supply Compression: Treasury lock-ups withdraw tokens from liquid supply without burning.

Max Supply Intact: No tokens are destroyed; 1 BVP ceiling remains fixed.

No Inflationary Rewards: Rebate-only model prevents uncontrolled token issuance.

Adaptive Governance: Fee slices, bridge fees, and lock periods can be tweaked by DAO as needs evolve.

Transparent UX: Users pay clear, rebate-backed fees—no hidden charges at mint or burn.


## Utility

* **Tiered Access Staking**: Stake BVP tokens to unlock tiered perks such as red-carpet invites, set visits, and cameo opportunities. No token rewards—staking solely grants access.

## Architecture

* **Layer 2 Chain**: Deployed on Arbitrum L2, leveraging the Nitro upgrade for high throughput and fast finality.
* **Gas Abstraction**: Supports gasless meta-transactions via ERC-4337 for seamless user experience.

## Subchain Strategy

* **Programmable Subchains**: Launch franchise-specific rollups via Arbitrum Orbit, inheriting mainnet security and liquidity with custom parameters.
* **Custom Gas Tokens**: Subchains can utilize BVPTOKEN or dedicated gas tokens to optimize costs, governance, and user experience.

#In‑House Rebate‑Only Subchain Overview

Based on our internal rebate‑only subchain mechanism—no burns, no rewards—this corporate chain architecture maximizes BVP value through transparent fee slices and refunds citeturn1file0:

Architecture & Flow: Ethereum L1 → Arbitrum Mainnet; L2 corporate chain with a GasRouter splitting 20% fees to treasury and 80% flows to core modules (Budget, Payroll, Revenue, Treasury, Governance).

L3 Micro‑Chains:

Production Ops: 0.005 BVP/tx (20% retained, 80% refunded)

Marketing & Distribution: Revenue→BVP (15% retained, 85% refunded)

Post‑Production & VFX: 10 BVP/mint (100% retained)

Finance & Compliance: Swap BVP→USDC (0.1% retained, net USDC refunded)

Treasury Management: Accumulates all fee slices and bridge fees, cliff‑locks funds for 60–90 days, and executes weekly sweeps to the L1 reserve vault.

Governance & Protections: DAO votes can tune fee slices, entry/exit fees, and lock durations in real time; on‑chain dashboards and quarterly attestations ensure full transparency and auditability.
